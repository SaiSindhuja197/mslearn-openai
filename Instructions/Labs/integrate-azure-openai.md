# Lab 01: Use Azure OpenAI SDKs in your app

## Estimated Duration: 40 Minutes

## Lab Scenario
With the Azure OpenAI Service, developers can create chatbots, language models, and other applications that excel at understanding natural human language. The Azure OpenAI provides access to pre-trained AI models, as well as a suite of APIs and tools for customizing and fine-tuning these models to meet the specific requirements of your application. In this exercise, you'll learn how to deploy a model in Azure OpenAI and use it in your own application.

In the scenario for this exercise, you will perform the role of a software developer who has been tasked to implement an app that can use generative AI to help provide hiking recommendations. The techniques used in the exercise can be applied to any app that wants to use Azure OpenAI APIs.

1. To save the changes made to the file, right-click on the blank space in the file text editor and hit **Save**

    >**Note:** Make sure to indent the code by eliminating any extra white spaces after pasting it into the code editor.

## Task 5: Test your application

Now that your app has been set up, you can just run it to send your request to your model and observe the response. You'll notice the only difference between the different options is the content of the prompt; all other parameters (such as token count and temperature) remain the same for each request.

1. In the folder of your preferred language, open the **system.txt** file. For each of the interactions, you'll enter the **System message** in this file and save it. Each iteration will pause first for you to change the system message.

1. In the interactive terminal pane, ensure the folder context is the folder for your preferred language. Then, enter the following command to run the application.
