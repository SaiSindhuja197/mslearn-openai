# Lab 06: Add your data for RAG with Azure OpenAI Service

## Estimated Duration: 75 Minutes

## Lab Overview
In this lab, you will learn how to connect your own data to the Azure OpenAI Service for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The Azure OpenAI Service enables you to use your own data with the intelligence of the underlying LLM. You can limit the model to only use your data for pertinent topics or blend it with results from the pre-trained model.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Observe normal chat behavior without adding your own data
- Task 2: Connect your data in the chat playground
- Task 3: Chat with a model grounded in your data
- Task 4: Set up an application in Cloud Shell
- Task 5: Configure your application
- Task 6: Run your application

## Task 1: Observe normal chat behavior without adding your own data

Before you connect Azure OpenAI to your data, you should first observe how the base model responds to queries without any grounding data.

1. In the **Playgrounds** section, select the **Chat (1)** option.

2. In the **Deployment** section in Chat page, ensure that your model deployment **my-gpt-model (2)** is selected.

3. In the **Setup** area, the default system message is set to *You are an AI assistant that helps people find information*.

   ![](../media/model-instr-2107.png)

4. In the **Chat session** on the right side, submit the following queries, and review the responses:

    ```
    I'd like to take a trip to New York. Where should I stay?
    ```

    ```
    What are some facts about New York?
    ```
    
    Try similar questions about tourism and places to stay for other locations that will be included in our grounding data, such as London or San Francisco. You'll likely get complete responses about areas or neighbourhoods, and some general facts about the city.

## Task 2: Connect your data in the chat playground

In this task, you will observe how the base model responds to queries without any grounding data before connecting Azure OpenAI to your data.

## Task 3: Chat with a model grounded in your data

In this task, you will ask the same questions as before in the chat section after adding your data, and observe how the responses differ.

   ```
   I'd like to take a trip to New York. Where should I stay?
   ```

   ```
   What are some facts about New York?
   ```

You'll notice a very different response this time, with specifics about certain hotels and a mention of Margie's Travel, as well as references to where the information provided came from. If you open the PDF reference listed in the response, you'll see the same hotels as the model provided. Try asking it about other cities included in the grounding data, which are Dubai, Las Vegas, London, and San Francisco.

> **Note:** **Add your data** is still in preview and might not always behave as expected for this feature, such as giving the incorrect reference for a city not included in the grounding data.

## Task 4: Set up an application in Cloud Shell

In this task, you will use a short command-line application running in Cloud Shell on Azure to demonstrate integration with an Azure OpenAI model. Open a new browser tab to access Cloud Shell.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), select the **[>_]** (*Cloud Shell*) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. A Cloud Shell pane will open at the bottom of the portal.

      ![Screenshot of starting Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon to the right of the top search box.](../media/cloudshell-launch-portal.png)

2. Make sure the type of shell indicated on the top left of the Cloud Shell pane is **Switch to PowerShell**. If it's *Bash*, select **Switch to Bash** and choose **Confirm** from the pop-up box.

    ![](../media/dev-genai-june-4.png)

3. Once the terminal opens, click on **Settings (1)** and select **Go to Classic version (2)**.

   ![](../media/classic-cloudshell-0108.png)

4. In the cloud shell pane, enter the following commands to clone the GitHub repo containing the code files for this exercise.

     ```
     rm -r mslearn-openai -f
     git clone https://github.com/microsoftlearning/mslearn-openai mslearn-openai
     ```

5. After the repo has been cloned, navigate to the folder containing the chat application code files
   
    ```bash
    cd mslearn-openai/Labfiles/02-use-own-data
    ```

    Applications for both C# and Python have been provided, as well as sample code we'll be using in this lab.

5. Open the built-in code editor, and you can observe the code files we'll be using in `sample-code`. Use the following command to open the lab files in the code editor.

    ```bash
   code .
    ```

## Task 5: Configure your application

In this task, you will complete key parts of the application to enable it to use your Azure OpenAI resource.

1. In the code editor, expand the language folder for your preferred language.

1. Open the configuration file for your language.

    - **C#**: `appsettings.json`
    - **Python**: `.env`

1. Update the configuration values to include:
    - The  **endpoint** and a **key** from the Azure OpenAI resource you created (Which you copied in the previous task). Alternatively, it is available on the **Keys and Endpoint** page for your Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal.
    - The **deployment name** you specified for your model deployment (available in the **Deployments** page in Azure AI Foundry portal that is **my-gpt-model**).
    - The endpoint for your AI search service (Which you copied in the previous task; alternatively, it is available in the **Url** value on the overview page for your AI search resource in the Azure portal).
    - A **key** for your search resource (available in the **Keys** page for your AI search resource in the Azure portal - you can use either of the admin keys)
    - The name of the search index (which should be `margiestravel`).

        ![](../media/L6T5S3-1807.png)

1. If you're using **C#**, navigate to `CSharp.csproj`, delete the existing code, then replace it with the following code, and then press **Ctrl+S** to save the file.

    ```
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
     
       <PropertyGroup>
         <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
         <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
         <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
         <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
         <LangVersion>12</LangVersion>
       </PropertyGroup>
     
       <ItemGroup>
         <PackageReference Include="Azure.AI.OpenAI" Version="2.1.0" />
         <PackageReference Include="Azure.Search.Documents" Version="11.6.0" />
         <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration" Version="8.0.0" />
         <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json" Version="8.0.0" />
         <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.3" />
       </ItemGroup>
     
       <ItemGroup>
         <None Update="appsettings.json">
           <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
         </None>
       </ItemGroup>
     
     </Project>
    ```    

    ![](../media/L6T5S4-1807.png)    

1. Navigate to the **CSharp** folder and install the necessary packages.

     **C#**:

    ```
    cd CSharp
    export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet
    export PATH=$DOTNET_ROOT:$PATH
    mkdir -p $DOTNET_ROOT
    ```     

     >**Note**: Azure Cloud Shell often does not have admin privileges, so you need to install .NET in your home directory. So here you are creating a separate `.dotnet` directory under your home directory to isolate your configuration.
     - `DOTNET_ROOT` specifies where your .NET runtime and SDK are located (in your `$HOME/.dotnet directory).
     - `PATH=$DOTNET_ROOT:$PATH` ensures that the locally installed .NET SDK can be accessed globally by your terminal.
     - `mkdir -p $DOTNET_ROOT` This creates the directory where the .NET runtime and SDK will be installed.

1. Run the following command to install the required SDK version locally:     

     ```
     wget https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/scripts/v1/dotnet-install.sh
     chmod +x dotnet-install.sh
     ./dotnet-install.sh --version 8.0.404 --install-dir $DOTNET_ROOT
     ```

      >**Note**: These commands download and prepare the official `.NET` installation script, grant it execute permissions, and install the required .NET SDK version (8.0.404) in the `$DOTNET_ROOT` directory as we don't have the admin privileges to install it globally.

1. Enter the following command to restore the workload.

    ```
    dotnet workload restore
    ```

     >**Note**: Restores any required workloads for your project, such as additional tools or libraries that are part of the .NET SDK.
    
1. Enter the following command to add the `Azure.AI.OpenAI` NuGet package to your project, which is necessary for integrating with Azure OpenAI services.

    ```
    dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI --version 1.0.0-beta.14
    ```

1. If you are using Python, navigate to the **Python** folder and install the necessary packages.

    **Python**:

    ```
    cd Python
    pip install python-dotenv
    pip install openai==1.56.2
    pip install openai requests python-dotenv
    ```
      > **Note:** If you receive a permission error after executing the installation command as shown in the image, please run the command below for installation.
      >    ![](../media/L2T3S9python-0205.png)
      > ```bash
      > pip install --user python-dotenv
      > pip install --user openai==1.56.2
      > pip install --user openai requests python-dotenv
      > ```

1. In the code editor, replace the comment Configure your data source with code to your index as a data source for chat completion:

    For **C#**: OwnData.cs

    ```csharp
    // Configure your data source
     // Extension methods to use data sources with options are subject to SDK surface changes. Suppress the warning to acknowledge this and use the subject-to-change AddDataSource method.
     #pragma warning disable AOAI001
     
     ChatCompletionOptions chatCompletionsOptions = new ChatCompletionOptions()
     {
        MaxOutputTokenCount = 600,
        Temperature = 0.9f,
     };
     
     chatCompletionsOptions.AddDataSource(new AzureSearchChatDataSource()
     {
        Endpoint = new Uri(azureSearchEndpoint),
        IndexName = azureSearchIndex,
        Authentication = DataSourceAuthentication.FromApiKey(azureSearchKey),
     });
    ```

    For **Python**: ownData.py

    ```python
    # Configure your data source
     text = input('\nEnter a question:\n')
     
     completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=deployment,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": text,
            },
        ],
        extra_body={
            "data_sources":[
                {
                    "type": "azure_search",
                    "parameters": {
                        "endpoint": os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT"],
                        "index_name": os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX"],
                        "authentication": {
                            "type": "api_key",
                            "key": os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_KEY"],
                        }
                    }
                }
            ],
        }
     )
    ```

1. Save the changes to the code file.

## Task 6: Run your application

In this task, you will run your configured app to send a request to your model and observe the response, noting that the only difference between options is the prompt content while all other parameters (such as token count and temperature) remain consistent.

In this task, you will run the reviewed code to generate some images.

1. In the Cloud Shell bash terminal, navigate to the folder for your preferred language.

2. In the interactive terminal pane, ensure the folder context is the folder for your preferred language. Then enter the following command to run the application.

    - **C#**: `dotnet run`
    - **Python**: `python ownData.py`

     >**Note**: If you encounter any errors after running the Python script, try upgrading the OpenAI package by running the following command:
        
    ```
    pip install --user --upgrade openai
    ```

    > **Tip**: You can use the **Maximize panel size** (**^**) icon in the terminal toolbar to see more of the console text.

3. Review the response to the prompt `Tell me about London`, which should include an answer as well as some details of the data used to ground the prompt, which was obtained from your search service.
