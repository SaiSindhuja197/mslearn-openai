# Lab 06: Add your data for RAG with Azure OpenAI Service

## Estimated Duration: 75 Minutes

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to connect your own data to the Azure OpenAI Service for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The Azure OpenAI Service enables you to use your own data with the intelligence of the underlying LLM. You can limit the model to only use your data for pertinent topics or blend it with results from the pre-trained model.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Observe normal chat behavior without adding your own data
- Task 2: Connect your data in the chat playground
- Task 3: Chat with a model grounded in your data
- Task 4: Set up an application in Cloud Shell
- Task 5: Configure your application
- Task 6: Run your application

## Task 1: Observe normal chat behavior without adding your own data

In this task, you will observe how the base model responds to queries without any grounding data.

1. In [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://oai.azure.com/?azure-portal=true), navigate to the **Chat (1)** section under **Playgrounds** in the left pane.

2. In the **Deployment** section in Chat page, ensure that your model deployment **my-gpt-model (2)** is selected.

3. In the **Setup** area, for the Give the model instructions and context, provide the following message and click on **Apply changes**.

    ```
    You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.
    ```

   ![](../media/model-instr-2107.png)

4. In the **Chat session** on the right side, submit the following queries, and review the responses:

    ```
    I'd like to take a trip to New York. Where should I stay?
    ```

    ```
    What are some facts about New York?
    ```
    
    Try similar questions about tourism and places to stay for other locations that will be included in our grounding data, such as London or San Francisco. You'll likely get complete responses about areas or neighbourhoods, and some general facts about the city.

## Task 2: Connect your data in the chat playground

In this task, you will observe how the base model responds to queries without any grounding data before connecting Azure OpenAI to your data.

## Task 3: Chat with a model grounded in your data

In this task, you will ask the same questions as before in the chat section after adding your data, and observe how the responses differ.

1. In the **Chat** session on the right side, submit the following queries, and review the responses:

   ```
   I'd like to take a trip to New York. Where should I stay?
   ```

   ```
   What are some facts about New York?
   ```

2. You'll notice a very different response this time, with specifics about certain hotels and a mention of Margie's Travel, as well as references to where the information provided came from. If you open the PDF reference listed in the response, you'll see the same hotels as the model provided. Try asking it about other cities included in the grounding data, which are Dubai, Las Vegas, London, and San Francisco.

    >**Note:** **Add your data** is still in preview and might not always behave as expected for this feature, such as giving the incorrect reference for a city not included in the grounding data.

## Task 4: Set up an application in Cloud Shell

In this task, you will use a short command-line application running in Cloud Shell on Azure to demonstrate integration with an Azure OpenAI model. Open a new browser tab to access Cloud Shell.

     git clone https://github.com/microsoftlearning/mslearn-openai mslearn-openai
     ```

5. After the repo has been cloned, navigate to the folder containing the chat application code files
   
    ```bash
    cd mslearn-openai/Labfiles/02-use-own-data
    ```

    Applications for both C# and Python have been provided, as well as sample code we'll be using in this lab.

5. Open the built-in code editor, and you can observe the code files we'll be using in `sample-code`. Use the following command to open the lab files in the code editor.

    ```bash
   code .
    ```

## Task 5: Configure your application

In this task, you will complete key parts of the application to enable it to use your Azure OpenAI resource.

1. In the code editor, expand the language folder for your preferred language.

1. Open the configuration file for your language.

    - **C#**: `appsettings.json`
    - **Python**: `.env`

1. Update the configuration file for your chosen language with the following values:

    - **Azure OpenAI endpoint**: Paste the endpoint URL from your Azure OpenAI resource (found on the Keys and Endpoint page in the Azure portal).
    - **Azure OpenAI key**: Paste the key from your Azure OpenAI resource (also on the Keys and Endpoint page).
    - **Deployment name**: Enter the name of your model deployment (e.g., `my-gpt-model` from the Deployments page in the Azure AI Foundry portal).
    - **Azure AI Search endpoint**: Paste the endpoint URL for your AI Search service (copied earlier or found in the overview page for your AI Search resource).
    - **Azure AI Search key**: Paste the admin key for your AI Search resource (available on the Keys page).
    - **Search index name**: Enter `margiestravel` as the index name.
    - Save your changes after updating these values.

        ![](../media/L6T5S3-1807.png)

1. If you're using **C#**, navigate to `CSharp.csproj`, delete the existing code, then replace it with the following code, and then press **Ctrl+S** to save the file.

    ```
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

    <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
        <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
        <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
        <LangVersion>12</LangVersion>
    </PropertyGroup>

    <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="Azure.AI.OpenAI" Version="2.1.0" />
        <PackageReference Include="Azure.Search.Documents" Version="11.6.0" />
        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration" Version="8.0.0" />
        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json" Version="8.0.0" />
        <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.3" />
    </ItemGroup>

    <ItemGroup>
        <None Update="appsettings.json">
        <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
        </None>
    </ItemGroup>

    </Project>
    ```    

    ![](../media/L6T5S4-1807.png)    

1. Navigate to the **CSharp** folder and install the necessary packages. These commands set up the environment for a local installation of the .NET SDK in Cloud Shell.

    ```
    cd CSharp
    export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet
    export PATH=$DOTNET_ROOT:$PATH
    mkdir -p $DOTNET_ROOT
    ```   

    - `DOTNET_ROOT` specifies where your .NET runtime and SDK are located (in your `$HOME/.dotnet directory).
    - `PATH=$DOTNET_ROOT:$PATH` ensures that the locally installed .NET SDK can be accessed globally by your terminal.
    - `mkdir -p $DOTNET_ROOT` This creates the directory where the .NET runtime and SDK will be installed.

1. Run the following command to install the required SDK version locally. These commands download and prepare the official `.NET` installation script, grant it execute permissions, and install the required .NET SDK version (8.0.404) in the `$DOTNET_ROOT` directory, as we don't have the admin privileges to install it globally.    

     ```
     wget https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/scripts/v1/dotnet-install.sh
     chmod +x dotnet-install.sh
     ./dotnet-install.sh --version 8.0.404 --install-dir $DOTNET_ROOT
     ``` 

1. Enter the following command to restore any required workloads for your project, such as additional tools or libraries that are part of the .NET SDK.

    ```
    dotnet workload restore
    ```

1. Enter the following command to add the `Azure.AI.OpenAI` NuGet package to your project, which is necessary for integrating with Azure OpenAI services.

    ```
    dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI --version 2.1.0
    dotnet add package Azure.Search.Documents --version 11.6.0
    ```

1. If you prefer **Python**, navigate to the **Python** folder and install the necessary packages using the commands below:

    ```
    cd Python
    python -m venv labenv
    ./labenv/bin/Activate.ps1
    pip install --user python-dotenv openai==1.65.2
    ```

1. In the code editor, replace the comment **Configure your data source** with code to your index as a data source for chat completion:

    For **C#**: OwnData.cs

    ```csharp
    // Configure your data source
     // Extension methods to use data sources with options are subject to SDK surface changes. Suppress the warning to acknowledge this and use the subject-to-change AddDataSource method.
     #pragma warning disable AOAI001
     
     ChatCompletionOptions chatCompletionsOptions = new ChatCompletionOptions()
     {
        MaxOutputTokenCount = 600,
        Temperature = 0.9f,
     };
     
     chatCompletionsOptions.AddDataSource(new AzureSearchChatDataSource()
     {
        Endpoint = new Uri(azureSearchEndpoint),
        IndexName = azureSearchIndex,
        Authentication = DataSourceAuthentication.FromApiKey(azureSearchKey),
     });
    ```

    For **Python**: ownData.py

    ```python
    # Configure your data source
    text = input('\nEnter a question:\n')
     
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=deployment,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": text,
            },
        ],
        extra_body={
            "data_sources":[
                {
                    "type": "azure_search",
                    "parameters": {
                        "endpoint": os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT"],
                        "index_name": os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX"],
                        "authentication": {
                            "type": "api_key",
                            "key": os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_KEY"],
                        }
                    }
                }
            ],
        }
    )
    ```

1. Save the changes to the code file.

## Task 6: Run your application

In this task, you will run your configured app to send a request to your model and observe the response, noting that the only difference between options is the prompt content while all other parameters (such as token count and temperature) remain consistent.

In this task, you will run the reviewed code to generate some images.

1. In the **Cloudshell** bash terminal, navigate to the folder for your preferred language.

2. In the interactive terminal pane, ensure the folder context is the folder for your preferred language. Then enter the following command to run the application.

    - **C#**: `dotnet run`
    - **Python**: `python ownData.py`

        >**Note**: If you encounter any errors after running the Python script, try upgrading the OpenAI package by running the following command:
        
        ```
        pip install --user --upgrade openai
        ```

3. Review the response to the prompt `Tell me about London`, which should include an answer as well as some details of the data used to ground the prompt, which was obtained from your search service.

## Summary

In this lab, you connected your own data to the Azure OpenAI Service for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You observed how the base model responds to queries without any grounding data, connected your data in the chat playground, and chatted with a model grounded in your data. You also set up an application in Cloud Shell, configured it to use your Azure OpenAI resource and AI search service, and ran the application to see how it integrates with the Azure OpenAI model.
