# Lab Scenario Preview: Generate code with Azure OpenAI Service

## Lab 04: Generate and improve code with Azure OpenAI Service

## Lab overview

The Azure OpenAI Service models are capable of generating code, fixing bugs, providing code comments, and explaining existing code using natural language prompts. These models simplify the coding process by allowing developers to describe their intentions in plain language, and they offer suggestions and fixes for debugging. They also provide helpful comments and insights on code structure and best practices. Overall, these models enhance the coding experience by assisting developers in various aspects of code generation and understanding.

In this lab, you will use these models which can explain and simplify complex code, help understand code functionality and suggest improvements.

## Lab objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Provision an Azure OpenAI resource
-   Deploy an OpenAI model within the Azure OpenAI studio
-   use the functionalites of the Azure OpenAI to generate and improvise code for your production applications.
