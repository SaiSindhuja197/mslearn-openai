   ![](../media/L1T3S1.png)

   ![](../media/L1T3S1i.png)

2. In the **Setup** pane:

   * Replace the default **System message (1)** with the following instruction:

     ```
     The system is an AI teacher that helps people learn about AI.
     ```
   * Click **Apply changes (2)** and confirm by selecting **Continue** on the prompt.

      ![](../media/L1T3S2.png)

      ![](../media/L1T3S2i.png)
   
1. In the **Setup (1)** section, click on **+ Add section (2)** box, then click on **Examples (3)**.

      ![](../media/L1T3S3.png)

1. Enter the following message and response in the designated boxes:

      - **User (1)**:
        ```
        What are the different types of artificial intelligence?
        ```
    
      - **Assistant (2)**:
        ```
        There are three main types of artificial intelligence: Narrow or Weak AI (such as virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, image recognition software, and spam filters), General or Strong AI (AI designed to be as intelligent as a human being. This type of AI does not currently exist and is purely theoretical), and Artificial Superintelligence (AI that is more intelligent than any human being and can perform tasks that are beyond human comprehension. This type of AI is also purely theoretical and has not yet been developed).
        ``` 

         ![](../media/L1T4S4-1607.png)
   
         > **Note**: Few-shot examples are used to provide the model with examples of the types of responses that are expected. The model will attempt to reflect the tone and style of the examples in its own responses.

1. Click **Apply changes**, then **Continue** to initialize the chat with the updated context.

      ![](../media/L1T4S5.1-1607.png)

      ![](../media/L1T3S2i.png)
   
1. In the query box at the bottom of the page, enter the below-mentioned text **(1)**. Use the **Send (2)** button to submit the message and view the response.

   ```
   What is artificial intelligence?
   ```

   ![](../media/L1T4S6-1607.png)
   
      > **Note**: You may receive a response that the API deployment is not yet ready. If so, wait for a few minutes and try again.

1. Review the response.

   ![](../media/L1T3S7.png)

1. After reviewing the response, submit the following follow-up message:

   ```
   `How is it related to machine learning?`
   ```

1. Review the response, noting that context from the previous interaction is retained (so the model understands that "it" refers to artificial intelligence).

     ![](../media/L1T3S8.png)

1. Use the **View Code** button to view the code for the interaction. The prompt consists of the *system* message, the few-shot examples of *user* and *assistant* messages, and the sequence of *user* and *assistant* messages in the chat session so far.

      ![](../media/170725(07).png)

## Task 4: Explore prompts and parameters

In this task, you'll explore prompts and parameters by experimenting with different inputs and settings to fine-tune the AI model's responses and behavior.

1. In the **Chat Configuration** pane, go to **Parameters (1)** and set the following values:

   * **Max response tokens (2)**: 500
   * **Temperature (3)**: 0 (for deterministic responses)

     ![](../media/image6.png)
      
2. In the chat input box, enter the message **(1)** and click **Submit (2)** to send it.

      ```
      Write three multiple-choice questions based on the following text.

      Most computer vision solutions are based on machine learning models that can be applied to visual input from cameras, videos, or images.*

      - Image classification involves training a machine learning model to classify images based on their contents. For example, in a traffic monitoring solution, you might use an image classification model to classify images based on the type of vehicle they contain, such as taxis, buses, cyclists, and so on.*

      - Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects within an image and identify their location with a bounding box. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might use object detection to identify the location of different classes of vehicles.*

      - Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might overlay traffic images with "mask" layers to highlight different vehicles using specific colors.
      ```

      ![](../media/L1T5S2-1607.png)

3. Review the results, which should consist of multiple-choice questions that a teacher could use to test students on the computer vision topics in the prompt. The total response should be smaller than the maximum length you specified as a parameter.

      ![](../media/last-3.jpg)
   
4. Observe the following about the prompt and parameters you used:

      - The prompt specifically states that the desired output should be three multiple-choice questions.
       
      - The parameters include *Temperature*, which controls the degree to which response generation includes an element of randomness. The value of **0** used in your submission minimizes randomness, resulting in stable, predictable responses.

## Task 5: Explore code generation

In this task, you'll explore code generation by testing the AI model’s ability to generate and suggest code snippets based on various programming prompts and requirements.

1. In the **Setup** pane, update the **System message (1)** to:

   ```
   You are a Python developer.
   ```

   * Click **Apply changes (2)** and then **Continue** when prompted.

     ![](../media/L1T5S1.png)

     ![](../media/L1T3S2i.png)

2. In the **Chat session** pane, select the **Clear chat** button, then select **Clear** from the pop-up window to clear the chat history and start a new session.

      ![](../media/clear-history-1607.png)

      ![](../media/L1T5S2i.png)

4. Enter the following prompt:

      ```
      Write a Python function named Multiply that multiplies two numeric parameters.
      ```

5. Review the generated Python code snippet. The model should return a valid function definition that multiplies two inputs and returns the result.
